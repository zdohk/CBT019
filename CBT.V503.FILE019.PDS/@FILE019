//*    This dataset contains several utility programs which         *   FILE 019
//*    may be of general interest to other installations.  They     *   FILE 019
//*    are, of course, available on an as-is condition with         *   FILE 019
//*    the usual disclaimer.  They all worked in our former         *   FILE 019
//*    OS/390 1.2 and DFSMS 1.3 environment.  They should all       *   FILE 019
//*    work on any level of ESA system.  Some may not work on       *   FILE 019
//*    XA or earlier systems.  Most have been now been tested       *   FILE 019
//*    to work, at least through z/OS 1.13 and z/OS 2.3.            *   FILE 019

//*    Each utility program has an associated member of a           *   FILE 019
//*    similar name starting with a '$' to provide                  *   FILE 019
//*    documentation for that utility.  There are also members      *   FILE 019
//*    starting with a '@' which are examples of ways to            *   FILE 019
//*    execute those utilities.  Read the documentation             *   FILE 019
//*    carefully to determine the utility's applicability to        *   FILE 019
//*    your environment.                                            *   FILE 019

//*        THIS PROGRAM WILL EXECUTE MVS OR JES2 COMMANDS WITHIN    *   FILE 019

//*        THIS WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO WAIT THE SPECIFIED        *   FILE 019
//*        NUMBER OF SECONDS BEFORE ISSUING THE NEXT COMMAND.       *   FILE 019
//*        THIS MAY GIVE TIME FOR THE PREVIOUS COMMAND TO BE        *   FILE 019
