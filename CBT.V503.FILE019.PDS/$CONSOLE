                     Console Interface for TSO

      This TSO command allows a TSO user to access the contents of the
      console buffer for a master console on an MVS/OS390/ZOS system.
      Security calls will be made that may also grant the user the
      authority to issue some or all operator commands as well.


                         System Requirements

      This TSO command requires that the system image on which it is
      executed have a non-SNA console active on that system with maxter
      console authority.


      Callers of this command will be tested for access to special RACF
      resources.  The are as follows:

      1)  CLASS "FACILITY" ENTITY "CONSOLE.FULL"

          READ access to this resource grants the user the authority to
          execute any console command.  The SYSLOG will echo the command
          and the user who issued the command.  This authority should be
          severely restricted.

      2)  CLASS "FACILITY" ENTITY "CONSOLE.DBA"

          READ access to this resource grants the user the authority to
          execute JES2 $D commands, MVS DISPLAY commands and a series of
          commands that control ADABASE, EDASERVE, AND DB2.  The list of
          authorized commands are hard coded in the program.

      3)  CLASS "FACILITY" ENTITY "CONSOLE.SECURITY"

          READ access to this resource grants the user the authority to
          execute JES2 $D commands, MVS DISPLAY commands and the modify
          command to CICS that will allow them to do NEWCOPIES since they
          perform the production PRODINS.

      4)  CLASS "FACILITY" ENTITY "CONSOLE.DISPLAY"

          READ access to this resource grants the user the authority to
          only execute JES2 $D commands and MVS DISPLAY commands.

      5)  If the user is not authorized to any of the previous resources,
          then the user cannot issue any commands except those that
          console the command execution such as UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or
          END.

      Newer releases of the MVS operating system and RACF may have
      created the need for operator command authority under the RACF
      resource class OPERCMDS.  This program does NOT bypass that
      authority and thus may require extra RACF authority to issue the
      commands that this utility may have authorized the user to execute.

      The SVC 34 command interface is used to issue commands from TSO
      that requires protect key zero.  Also, the console buffers are in
      the CONSOLE address space requiring this program to go into protect
      key zero and cross-memory mode to access their contents.  This
      requires that this program be APF authorized and in the TSO
      authorized commands list.
