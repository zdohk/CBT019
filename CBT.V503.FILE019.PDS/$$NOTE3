We've been using the "FLSMFxxx" reports for quite some time, so I
was pleased to see there was something new added to it and I
appreciate Peter Hunkeler's work.  However, I think I've discovered a
bit of a problem - specifying "NOSTC" can also result in "NOTSO".

I'm not much of an assembler programmer, but I changed the test for
"not TSU" below to a positive test for "STC" and then a second test
for "S0" with a branch on equal to READREC. The "reverse logic"
worked in the older version because there were only 3 choices - JOB,
TSU, or STC.  In my environment, TSU06446 fails the second test and
is therefore not included in my report.

The code as distributed:

CKMISC4 TM SWITCH+3,SELNOSTC  SEE IF NOSTC SPECIFIED
BNO CKMISC5                   NO, BRANCH
CLC INJNM(3),=C'JOB'          SEE IF BATCH JOB
BE CKMISC5                    YES, OK
CLC INJNM(2),=C'J0'           SEE IF BATCH JOB - Z2 MODE
BE CKMISC5                    YES, OK
CLC INJNM(3),=C'TSU'          SEE IF TSO USER
BNE READREC                   NO, MUST BE STC
CLC INJNM(2),=C'T0'           SEE IF TSO USER - Z2 MODE
BNE READREC                   NO, MUST BE STC
CKMISC5 TM SWITCH+3,SELNOTSU  SEE IF NOTSU SPECIFIED
BNO CKMISC6                   NO, BRANCH
CLC INJNM(3),=C'TSU'          SEE IF TSO USER
BE READREC                    YES, BYPASS RECORD
CLC INJNM(2),=C'T0'           SEE IF TSO USER - Z2 MODE
BE READREC                    YES, BYPASS RECORD
CKMISC6 BR R14                RETURN TO CALLER
SPACE 3


Here's the modification I made:


CKMISC4 TM SWITCH+3,SELNOSTC  SEE IF NOSTC SPECIFIED
BNO CKMISC5                   NO, BRANCH
CLC INJNM(3),=C'JOB'          SEE IF BATCH JOB
BE CKMISC5                    YES, OK
CLC INJNM(2),=C'J0'           SEE IF BATCH JOB - Z2 MODE
BE CKMISC5                    YES, OK
CLC INJNM(3),=C'STC'          SEE IF STC
BE READREC                    YES, BYPASS RECORD
CLC INJNM(2),=C'S0'           SEE IF TSO USER - Z2 MODE
BE READREC                    YES, BYPASS RECORD
CKMISC5 TM SWITCH+3,SELNOTSU  SEE IF NOTSU SPECIFIED
BNO CKMISC6                   NO, BRANCH
CLC INJNM(3),=C'TSU'          SEE IF TSO USER
BE READREC                    YES, BYPASS RECORD
CLC INJNM(2),=C'T0'           SEE IF TSO USER - Z2 MODE
BE READREC                    YES, BYPASS RECORD
CKMISC6 BR R14                RETURN TO CALLER
SPACE 3
