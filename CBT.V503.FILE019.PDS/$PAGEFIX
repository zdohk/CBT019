         This program is designed to limit real storage available to a
         CPU by acquiring storage according to a value specified in
         the input parm or entered by a MODIFY command from the
         console. The storage area will then be initialized and fixed
         to prevent paging while waiting for the next STOP/MODIFY
         console command.

         We use this utility occasionally for 2 reasons.  We have used
         it to reserve recently added memory for an application that
         has yet to be implemented.  Most commonly we have used it to
         see where the happy value is for our real storage.  We keep
         increasing the memory reserved by this utility to determine
         the effect this has on paging.

         The value given to the program by the execution
         parm or the MODIFY command must be in the form
         nnnnnM (megabytes) where the value must not exceed
         the maximum available to the job or task.

         A MODIFY frees the previously fixed storage prior
         to satisfying the new request.

 Message Format: PGFX0000 - CURRENT SIZE nnnnnM  MAX SIZE nnnnnM

         Action: Information only

    Description: This message is generated by an operator
                 F PAGEFIX,STATUS command.  This message will
                 display that current status of the utility
                 program


 Message Format: PGFX0000 - REQUEST FOR nnnnnM

         Action: Information only

    Description: This message is generated by an operator
                 F PAGEFIX,nnnnM command.  This message will
                 echo the operator request.


 Message Format: PGFX0001 - PROGRAM NOT PROPERLY AUTHORIZED -
                            REQUEST WILL TERMINATE

         Action: The utility will stop

    Description: This message can be generated during initialization
                 processing when it validates that the program has
                 full APF authority.  Certain internal processing
                 requires that level of authorization and cannot
                 function without it.


 Message Format: PGFX0002 - UNKNOWN SYSTEM COMMUNICATION

         Action: The utility ignores the request

    Description: The utility received an external request from an
                 unknown origin.  The request should come from the
                 traditional console communication control blocks.
                 this is probably an internal error.


 Message Format: PGFX0003 - INVALID MODIFY VALUE - MUST BE IN THE
                            FORM nnnnnM

         Action: The utility ignores the request

    Description: The utility received an external request through an
                 operator MODIFY command.  The request must be either
                 the keyword STATUS or a memory value in the form of
                 nnnnnM.


 Message Format: PGFX0004 - INVALID MODIFY VALUE - CANNOT EXCEED
                            nnnnnM

         Action: The utility ignores the request

    Description: The utility received an external request through an
                 operator MODIFY command.  The request was for a
                 memory value greater than that allowed by the
                 utility.  The default maximum value is 500M.


 Message Format: PGFX0005 - PGFREE FOR STORAGE FAILED

         Action: The utility will abend with a U005 abend

    Description: The utility was attempting to release the memory lock
                 on a prior request for storage during modify
                 processing for a new storage value.  The request
                 failed.  This is an internal error.


 Message Format: PGFX0005 - PGFIX FOR STORAGE FAILED

         Action: The utility will abend with a U005 abend

    Description: The utility was attempting to lock the memory for a
                 storage request.  The request failed.  This is an
                 internal error.


 Message Format: PGFX0006 - PGFREE FOR STORAGE FAILED

         Action: The utility will abend with a U006 abend

    Description: The utility was attempting to release the memory lock
                 on a prior request for storage during utility
                 termination processing.  The request failed.  This is
                 an internal error.
