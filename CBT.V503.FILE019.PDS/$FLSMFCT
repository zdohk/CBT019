         This utility is intended to list catalog activity at the
         dataset level for batch jobs, started tasks, and TSO users
         on the MVS system.  It provides a flexible selection and
         sort mechanism to tailor the report.  The following
         information can be provided for each selected catalog
         update event:

         JOBNAME   - The name of the batch job, task, or TSO user.

         DATE      - The Julian date that the catalog update occurred.

         TIME      - The time of day that the catalog update occurred.

         SYSID     - The name of the MVS system which processed the
                     catalog update request.

         OPERATION - The type of catalog update event which was
                     recorded.

         DSTYPE    - The type of dataset catalog entry which was
                     being updated.

         DSNAME    - The name of the dataset catalog entry which was
                     being updated.

         TYPE      - The job type T (test) or P (production) for the
                     job which updated the catalog.

         CATNAME   - The name of the catalog which was updated.

         DAYOFWEEK - The day of the week, SUN - SAT, that the catalog
                     update occurred.  It is based upon the DATE.

         The SYSIN file and any control statements are optional.  If
         neither is present, then all catalog activity for all jobs
         is included in the report.  Note that this can be a huge
         report since all datasets which are being created, updated
         and deleted for every batch job, started task, and TSO user
         will be listed.  It is anticipated that this report will
         usually be limited by specific control statements which
         will specify which of the activity will be included on the
         report.  Following is a list of the input control
         statements.  A detailed description of each entry will
         follow this list.

         An asterisk in front of an option denotes that up to 1000
         of these statements may be entered as selection criteria.

                        Special Date/Time Issues

         Selection of data by date and time is, by necessity,
         a little convoluted.  There are two different date and
         time conditions that arise:

         1)  Need for all data for the same time range for
             several days.  The example that comes to mind
             is wanting all activity from 8:00am to 5:00pm
             for a date range.  Following is how to accomplish
             this:

             DATE=2003/07/07:2003/07/11
             TIME=08.00:17.00

             This would display only activity for datasets
             during prime shift on the specified dates.

         2)  Need for all data from a specific time on a
             given day until a specific time on another day.
             This allows processing an interval that crosses
             the nidnight time line.  Following is how to
             accomplish this:

             DATE=2003/07/09:2003/07/10
             TIME=11.00:13.00
             TIMEINCLUSIVE

             This would display only activity for datasets
             that were processed after 11:00am on the first
             day until 01:00am on the second day.


         See the additional documentation for DATE, TIME,
         and TIMEINCLUSIVE for details.  With the flexability
         provided by this utility it really can get a little
         confusing.

             That is, any job which starts with the specified
             characters will be selected.  Note that jobs selected
             by this statement may be excluded by an EXJOBNAME

             indicate that the specified name starts other than in
             position 1 of the job name.  A name of less than 8
             characers is assumed to be generic.  That is, any job

             specified.

         5)  TIMEINCLUSIVE

             start time of the report on the earliest date of
             any date range and that the latest time of any
             range will be used as the end time of the report
             on the latest date of any date range.  Note that
             this keyword indicates that at least one date

             Delete and uncatalog activity is different from scratch

             ALIASES JTYPE/TYPE

             Select only catalog activity which was performed by
             jobs of one of the specified type.  This will be either
             T for test jobs or P for production jobs.  Note that

             ALIASES STOPCOUNT/STOPCNT

             This option limits the report to only printing the first
             nnnnnnnnn selected entries.  This is after any other
             optional control statements may have eliminated any
             entries.  This will be the first nnnnn selectable type 61
             65, or 66 records if the SORT option is not taken or the
             first nnnnn records in the sort sequence if the SORT
             option is taken.  The value must not exceed 9 digits.

         16) SUNDAY/NOSUNDAY
             MONDAY/NOMONDAY
             TUESDAY/NOTUESDAY
             WEDNESDAY/NOWEDNESDAY
             THURSDAY/NOTHURSDAY
             FRIDAY/NOFRIDAY
             SATURDAY/NOSATURDAY
             WEEKDAY/NOWEEKDAY
             WEEKEND/NOWEEKEND
             ALLDAYS/EVERYDAY

             These control statements, when used in combination, will
             select data based upon the day of the week.  They are
             processed in the order received.  No data is automatically
             included.  At least one "including" statement must be
             entered if any of these statements are entered.  If none
             of these statements are used, all days are selected.

             Day of the week selection involves turning on and off
             the specified or implied days of the week.  The resulting
             list of days of the week are used for selection.  The
             control statements are processed in the order received.
             A control statement can specify or imply a day or group
             of days and a later one can negate it.  It is the final
             list of days that is used.  If the final list does not
             include any days, an error message is issued.

         17) SORT=OPT1,OPT2,OPT3,OPT4,OPT5
             Where sorting of the input data is requested in the
             order in which the following options are listed:

             A)  CATNAME/CATALOG
             B)  DATE

             J)  TIME

             Note that each keyword can be suffixed by "(A)" or
             "(D)" for ascending or descending sort sequence.
             The default is "(A)" for ascending

             A maximum of five of the above options may be made
             on a given run.

             If an option is not specified, no sorting on that
             field will be made.

             Sorting on DAYOFTHEWEEK will sort Sunday first through
             Saturday which will be last.

         18) PRINT=FIELD1,FIELD2,FIELD3, ... FIELD.
             WHERE the default fields to be printed are being
             overridden to include only the specified field
             names.

             A)  CATNAME/CATALOG
             B)  DATE
             C)  GDATE
             D)  DAYOFTHEWEEK
             E)  DSNAME/DATASET

             I)  OPERATION
             J)  SYSTEM/SYSID
             K)  TIME

             Only as many field names can be entered whose values
             will fit on a 133 character print line.

             More than one PRINT statement can be used if a large
             number of field names is being specified.

             If a PRINT statement is not included, the following
             fields will be printed:

             JOBNAME,GDATE,TIME,SYSID,OPERATION,DSTYPE,DSNAME,
             JOBTYPE

        Many of the error messages refer to errors on optional control
        statements.  The control statement is always written to the
        SYSPRINT report file prior to performing syntax checking.  The
        last control statement printed will be the one containing the
        specified error.
