Hi Sam,

My name is Marty French from St. Luke's Regional Medical Center
in Boise Idaho.  I am a Systems Programmer.

On FILE 019, there is a program called FLSMFJOB.  This program
reads SMF type 30 records and reports job statistics, etc.  It
worked well until I implemented long job numbers under z/OS 1.4
Z2 mode.  You can now have 999,999 job numbers.  The old job
numbers started with STC, TSU, and JOB.  Now they start with S0,
T0, and J0.

I made a fix to the program and I'm attaching the fix.
All changes can be found by searching for "Z2".

Please let me know if you need any more information.

Regards,
Marty
