         This utility is intended to list dataset activity for all
         batch jobs, started tasks, and TSO users on the MVS system.
         It provides a flexible selection and sort mechanism to tailor
         the report.  The following information can be provided for
         each selected dataset:

         JOBNAME   - The name of the batch job, task, or TSO user.

         ODATE     - The date that the dataset was opened for
                     access.  It is only accurate for non-VSAM
                     datasets.  For other datasets, this field is
                     set to match CDATE.  This can be displayed in
                     Julian or Gregorian format.

         CDATE     - The date that the dataset was closed, ending
                     access.  This can be displayed in Julian or
                     Gregorian format.

         OTIME     - The time of day that the dataset was opened for
                     access.  It is only accurate for non-VSAM
                     datasets.  For other datasets, this field is
                     set to match CTIME.

         CTIME     - The time of day that the dataset was closed,
                     ending access.

         SYSID     - The name of the MVS system which processed the
                     dataset.

         DSNAME    - The name of the dataset being processed.

         DDNAME    - The filename within the job which defined the
                     dataset being processed.

         ACCESS    - The access type - either Input or Output - of the
                     dataset activity.

         UNIT      - The unit name - either DISK or TAPE - of the
                     device containing the dataset.

         VOLSER    - The name of the volume containing the dataset.

         MGMTCLAS  - The name of the SMS Management Class.

         STORCLAS  - The name of the SMS Storage Class.

         DATACLAS  - The name of the SMS Data Class.

         DSORG     - The organization (partitioned, sequential, etc.)
                     of the dataset.

         RECFM     - The record format of the dataset.

         LRECL     - The logical record length of the dataset.

         BLKSIZE   - The physical block size of the dataset.

         EXCPS     - The total I/O count for the dataset which was
                     being processed.

         TYPE      - The job type T (test) or P (production) for the
                     job.

        ODAYOFWEEK - The day of the week, SUN - SAT, that the dataset
                     was opened for access.  This value is accurate
                     for non-VSAM datasets only.  For other datasets,
                     this value is set to match CDAY.  It is based on
                     ODATE.

        CDAYOFWEEK - The day of the week, SUN - SAT, that the dataset
                     was closed, ending access.  It is based on CDATE.

        RDELETED   - The number of records deleted from the file.  This
                     only has meaning for VSAM files.  It will be zero
                     for non-VSAM files.

        RINSERTED  - The number of records inserted into the file.  This
                     only has meaning for VSAM files.  It will be zero
                     for non-VSAM files.

        RUPDATED   - The number of records updated in the file.  This
                     only has meaning for VSAM files.  It will be zero
                     for non-VSAM files.

        RREAD      - The number of records read from the file.  This
                     only has meaning for VSAM files.  It will be zero
                     for non-VSAM files.

        CISPLITS   - The number of Control Interval (CI) splits which
                     have occurred for the file.  This only has meaning
                     for VSAM files.  It will be zero for non-VSAM
                     files.

        CASPLITS   - The number of Control Area (CA) splits which
                     have occurred for the file.  This only has meaning
                     for VSAM files.  It will be zero for non-VSAM
                     files.

        EXTENTS    - The number of extents which make up the dataset.
                     Non-VSAM datasets can have 16 per volume.  VSAM
                     files are limited to a total of 256 extents total.

          An optional title can be placed on the output report by
          specifying an input parm on the EXECute statement.  This
          title can be up to 50 characters in length.  If more than
          50 characters are specified, the first 50 are used.  If the
          default titles are sufficient, do not specify a parm.


          The DATAOUT file is optional.  If a DD statement is present,
          a record for each selected dataset will be written to this
          file.  The DCB parameter is shown for documentation purposes
          but may, and should, be omitted.  The syntax of the DATAOUT
          record is as follows:

         The SYSIN file and any control statements are optional.  If
         neither is present, then all datasets for all jobs are
         included in the report.  Note that this can be a huge report
         since all dataset activity for every batch job, started task,
         and TSO user will be listed.  It is anticipated that this
         report will usually be limited by specific control statements
         which will specify which of the input records will be
         included on the report.  Following is a list of the input
         control statements.  A detailed description of each entry
         will follow this list.

         An asterisk in front of an option denotes that up to 1000
         of these statements may be entered as selection criteria.

             as long as another option could not also be abbreviated
             to the same name.



                        Special Date/Time Issues

         Selection of data by date and time is, by necessity, a little
         convoluted.  The SMF data for the information formatted by this
         utility has two different dates and times.  There is the open
         date and time for the dataset as well as the close date and
         time that is the time when the SMF record was created.  Being
         able to select by either is desirable.

         There are also two different date and time conditions that
         arise:

         1)  Need for all data for the same time range for several days.
             The example that comes to mind is wanting all activity from
             8:00am to 5:00pm for a date range.  Following is how to
             accomplish this:

             DATE=2003/07/07:2003/07/11
             OTIME=08.00:17.00

             This would display only activity for datasets that were
             opened during prime shift on the specified dates.

         2)  Need for all data from a specific time on a given day until
             a specific time on another day.  This allows processing an
             interval that crosses the midnight time line.  Following is
             how to accomplish this:

             DATE=2003/07/09:2003/07/10
             OTIME=11.00
             CTIME=13.00
             TIMEINCLUSIVE

             This would display all dataset opened and closed from
             11:00am on the first day until 01:00pm on the second day.


         See the additional documentation for DATE, OTIME, CTIME, and
         TIMEINCLUSIVE for details.  With the flexability provided by
         this utility it really can get a little confusing.

         1)  TIMEINCLUSIVE

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Requests that any time ranges that are specified by the
             OTIME or CTIME keywords are inclusive.  That is, the
             earliest time of any range will be used as the start time
             of the report on the first day of the date range and that
             the latest time of any range will be used as the end time
             of the report on the last day of the report.  The
             exception to this is if the CTIME value only specifies a
             single time in which case it will be used as if it was the
             end time of the range.  Note that this keyword indicates
             that at least one DATE range and one OTIME or CTIME range
             must be specified.

             the specified name starts other than in position 1 of the
             job name.  A name of less than 8 characers is assumed to
             be generic.  That is, any job which starts with the
             specified characters will be selected.  Note that jobs
