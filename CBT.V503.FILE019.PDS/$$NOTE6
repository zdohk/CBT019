Hi,
my name is Orazio, from Italy.
I'm 67, an old system engineer, professionally born in IBM 38 years ago.

My customer required me a report on the SMS storage usage.
Without the program FLSMFDSN, I'd have serious difficult 'cause I'm not
used to write programs every days...

Fortunately for me, John Hooper was a genius!

I'm very impressed: this program is excellent, and had been written very
scalable.

It processes SMF record type 14, 15, and 64, reporting just what I need.
I only had to modify it for managing the SMS informations, such as
MGMTCLAS, STORCLAS, and DATACLAS.

So I applied 'some' changes to the original version 4.1 (saved as
FLSMFDSZ), so realizing my 4.2 that I'd like to provide you, for any
usage you want.

Sorry, I didn't test all of the functions, just only for my purposes.

In the attached zip file, you find the modified sources of FILE019 in
xmit format.

Kind regards,
Orazio
