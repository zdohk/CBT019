Hi Sam,

I finally finished the update to the FLSMFJOB program on File
019. There is a new keyword CPUTIMEFRACTS to request that all CPU
time values are treated with hundredths of a second instead of
with full seconds only.

Please find attached the updated and zipped File 019 library in
TSO XMIT format. the following members have been updated:

 $FLSMFJB
 @FLSMFJB
 FLSMFJOB
and
 @FILE019

All changes in the assembler source code in FLSMFJOB are marked
with @PHUN01. Descriptions in FLSMFJOB as well as in $FLSMFJB
have been changed as well.

May I kindly ask you to consider this for the next CBTTAPE
update.

Best regards
Peter
