Hi Sam,

I have some minor updates for File 19.  One relates to the issue
from China.  It turns out that the problem is the SMF Type 30
record itself.  The subtype 5 record (job level) does not contain
all of the step return codes.  It normally contains the return
code from the last step unless a prior step had abended.  In that
case is contains a return code of S000.  In any event the return
code is not what was expected.  The program has been updated with
comments as has the help member.  If they ever put the return
codes for all steps in the record it will now extract the
highest.  I wouldn t hold my breath for IBM to make that change.
It s the best I could do.

I will respond to the original email from home about the update.

Thanks for all you do.  I did enjoy our conversation.

Hi

  When we try to use FLSMFJOB ASM Program(CBT FILE019),we met a
  problem that the job return code cannot reflect the jobstep
  return codes correctly.  For example,when we use JOBLEVEL, we get
  the job retrucn code(CCODE) is 0, but this job's jobsteps CCODE
  maybe 0?4? FLUSH.

In member $FLSMFJB,it tell us job CCODE use highest value of
JOBSTEPS CCODE when we use JOBLEVEL.

         CCODE     - The step completion code for the step which was
                     executed, the highest step completion code for
                     the job if JOBLEVEL is selected, or blanks if
                     INTERVAL is selected.

Why do I get wrong result about it? My OS is OS/390 V2R10. Could
you help me for it?

Attached pls find the Program and JCL I used and the output data.Fyr.
