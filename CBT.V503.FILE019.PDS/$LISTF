                           LISTF TSO COMMAND


 Purpose    - List the free space on one or more DASD volumes.

 Syntax     - LISTF <select>
                    <Totals/NOTotals>
                    <Hardinfo/NOHardinfo>
                    <SMsonly/NOSMs>
                    <Ixvtoconly/NOIxvtoc>
                    <Volser(volume)>
                    <Unitaddress/Address(unit-address)>
                    <Devicetype(device-type)>
                    <SToragegroup(storage-group-name)>
                    <SOrt(sort-opt1,A/D,sort-opt2,A/D,sort-opt3,A/D)>

              select          This parameter specifies the full volser,
                              volser prefix, unit address, or unit
                              address prefix of the dasd volumes to be
                              listed.  Either the volser or unit
                              address can be masked.  That is, that
                              value can contain a "?" character
                              indicating that that position will not be
                              considered in determining a match on the
                              search criteria.  If this parameter
                              starts with an "@", then the characters
                              that follow specify a unit address.  This
                              unit address is a 1 to 4 digit value
                              which specifies the full or generic
                              device address of the volume(s) to be
                              listed.  If the value does not start with
                              an "@", the the value is assumed to be a
                              1 to 6 digit volser or generic volser.  A
                              special value of "*" will list all online
                              volumes.  If no value is entered, it will
                              list the user's default volumes.  based
                              upon an internal table related to a
                              user's default TSO unitname.  Note that
                              this value can be overridden or used in
                              conjunction with the VOLSER or
                              UNITADDRESS optional keywords.

              Totals          This optional keyword indicates that the
              NOTotals        total freespace as well as the largest
                              extent is to be displayed at the end of
                              the list.  NOTotals indicates that these
                              totals will not be displayed.  NOTOTAL
                              is the default.

              Hardinfo        This optional keyword indicates that the
              NOHardinfo      display will show hardware related
                              to that device instead of used or free
                              space.  Of notable information will be
                              the total number of cylinders on the
                              volume and the number of alternate
                              cylinders for that volume.  NOHARDINFO
                              is the default.

              SMsonly         This optional keyword indicates that
              NOSMs           volume selection is to be made on the
                              basis of whether or not the volume is an
                              SMS volume.  Only SMS volumes will be
                              displayed if SMSONLY is specified.  Only
                              non-SMS volumes will be displayed if
                              NOSMS is entered.  The default is to
                              display both SMS and non-SMS volumes.

              Ixvtoconly      This optional keyword indicates that
              NOIxvtoc        volume selection is to be made on the
                              basis of whether or not the volume has an
                              active indexed Volume Table of Contents
                              (VTOC).  This performance feature is
                              optional for non-SMS volumes but is
                              required for SMS volumes.  The system can
                              disable this feature if errors occur.  An
                              SMS volume without an index VTOC will not
                              be selected for new datasets.  The
                              default is to display volumes reguardless
                              of its index VTOC status.

              Volser(value)   This parameter specifies the 1 to 6
                              character volser or volser prefix of the
                              dasd volumes to be listed.  It can also
                              be masked with a "?" indicating that that
                              position in the volser will not be used
                              as part of the selection criteria.  This
                              value will override the select option
                              specified as the first parameter of the
                              command if it was a volser or will be
                              used in conjuntion with the select option
                              if it was a unit address. It will also be
                              used in conjunction with the UNITADDRESS
                              optional keyword if specified.

                              EXAMPLE:  The following command will list
                                        all volumes starting with the
                                        characters PRD.

                                        LISTF * VOL(PRD)

              Address(value)  This parameter specifies the 1 to 4
              Unitaddress     digit unit address or prefix of the
                              device address for the dasd volumes be
                              listed. It can also be masked with a "?"
                              indicating that this position of the
                              unit address will not be used in the
                              selection criteria.  This value will
                              override the select option specified as
                              the first parameter of the command if it
                              was a device address or will be used in
                              conjuntion with the select option if it
                              was a volser.  It will also be used in
                              conjunction with the VOLSER optional
                              keyword if specified.

                              EXAMPLE:  The following command will list
                                        all volumes starting with
                                        unit address 021

                                        LISTF * ADDRESS(021)

              Devicetype(vvv) This parameter specifies the full device
                              type of the volume(s) to be listed.  We
                              have a number of different types of dasd
                              volumes on our system.  If a specific
                              type is desired, then this parameter can
                              be used to limit the list.  Some examples
                              of device type are "3380", "3390",
                              "3390-2", "3390-3", and "3390-9".

                              EXAMPLE:  The following command will list
                                        all volumes with a device type
                                        of 3390-3

                                        LISTF ALL DEVICETYPE(3390-3)

              SToragegroup(sg) This parameter specifies the SMS Storage
                              group name that is to be listed.  The
                              name is assumed to be the full name.  If
                              a generic name is desired, the name must
                              end with an asterisk.  That is, a storage
                              group name of SGTSP will list only
                              volumes in Storage Group SGTSP.  A
                              storage group name SGTSP* will list
                              volumes in Storage Group SGTSP, SGTSP2,
                              SGTSP3, etc.

                              EXAMPLE:  The following command will list
                                        all volumes in storage group
                                        SGSYS:

                                        LISTF ALL STORAGEGROUP(SGSYS)

              SOrt(options)   This parameter specifies the order in
                              which the list of volume(s) to be listed.
                              The sort option is actually a pair of
                              values consisting of a field name and a
                              sort order indicator of a "A" for ascending
                              or a "D" for descending.  Up to 3 sort
                              options can be specified.  Most of the
                              fields on the display line can be used
                              for sorting.  Following is a list of
                              possible field names:

                              Address/UNitaddress

 Detail Line Description:

 VOLUME NAME         The 6 digit volser of the volume
 DEV ADR             The device address of the volume
 DEVICE TYPE         The device type of the volume as determined
                     from internal control blocks for that device.
 SM                  SMS indicator - Y indicates that it is an SMS

                     volume has an index VTOC
 STORAGE GROUP       The storage group in which this volume resides
                     if SMS
 SG ST               The storage group status for this volue.  If
                     blank, everything is OK.  If it contains **, then
                     there is a logical problem such as an SMS volume
                     not being in a storage group or a volume being
                     in a storage group but not being an SMS volume.
