         This utility is intended to list job activity at the step or
         job level, depending on execution options, for all batch jobs,
         started tasks, and TSO users on the MVS system.  It provides a
         flexible selection and sort mechanism to tailor the report.
         The following information can be provided for each selected
         job or job step:

         JOBNAME   - The name of the batch job, task, or TSO user.

         JOBNO     - The JES2 job number of the job, task, or TSO user.

         SDATE     - The date that the step began execution,
                     when the job began if JOBLEVEL is selected, or
                     when the SMF recording interval started if
                     INTERVAL is selected.  This can be displayed
                     in Julian or Gregorian format.

         STIME     - The time of day that the step began execution,
                     when the job began if JOBLEVEL is selected, or
                     when the SMF recording interval started if
                     INTERVAL is selected.

         EDATE     - The date that the step ended execution,
                     when the job ended if JOBLEVEL is selected, or
                     when the SMF recording interval ended if
                     INTERVAL is selected.  This can be displayed
                     in Julian or Gregorian format.

         ETIME     - The time of day that the step ended execution,
                     when the job ended if JOBLEVEL is selected, or
                     when the SMF recording interval ended if
                     INTERVAL is selected.

         SYSID     - The name of the MVS system which executed the job.

         PROCSTEP  - The name of the step within a cataloged procedure
                     which was executed or blanks if JOBLEVEL is
                     selected.

         JOBSTEP   - The name of the step which executed the program or
                     cataloged procedure which was executed or blanks
                     if JOBLEVEL is selected.

         PROGRAM   - The name of the program which was executed for the
                     step or blanks if JOBLEVEL is selected.

         USERID    - The name of the security id for the job which was
                     executed.

         CCODE     - The step completion code for the step which was
                     executed.  It will be blanks if INTERVAL is
                     selected.  It will usually contain the completion
                     code for the last step that was executed if
                     JOBLEVEL is selected.  For JOBLEVEL the value
                     will be either 0000 or S000 if the last step was
                     bypassed for condition codes or failed with a JCL
                     error.  That value depends on whether or not a
                     prior step had abended.  In other words, this
                     field has little value when JOBLEVEL is selected.

         ELAPTIME  - The elapsed wall time for the step which was
                     executed, for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected,

                     selected.

         CPUTIME   - The CPU time for the step which was executed,
                     for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected, or for the
                     recording interval if INTERVAL is selected.

         ZAAPCPU   - The CPU time executed on a ZAAP speciality engine
                     for the step which was executed, for the job if
                     JOBLEVEL is selected, or for the recording
                     interval if INTERVAL is selected.

         ZIIPCPU   - The CPU time executed on a ZIIP speciality engine
                     for the step which was executed, for the job if
                     JOBLEVEL is selected, or for the recording
                     interval if INTERVAL is selected.

         SPECCPU   - The CPU time executed on either a ZAAP or a ZAAP
                     speciality engine for the step which was
                     executed, for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected, or
                     for the recording interval if INTERVAL is
                     selected.

                     for the step which was executed, the maximum
                     region used for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected,
                     or the actual region used during the recording
                     interval if INTERVAL is selected.

         REGIONA   - The actual region used above the 16 meg line
                     for the step which was executed, the maximum
                     region used for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected,
                     or the actual region used during the recording
                     interval if INTERVAL is selected.

         MOUNTS    - The number of tape mounts for the step which was
                     executed, for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected,
                     or the tape mounts during the recording interval
                     if INTERVAL is selected.

         EXCPS     - The total I/O count for the step which was
                     executed, for the job if JOBLEVEL is selected,
                     or the I/O count during the recording interval

                     duration of the job if JOBLEVEL is selected, or
                     the CPU percent during the recording interval
                     if INTERVAL is selected.  This number is
                     calculated by dividing the CPU time by the
                     elapsed time which gives a percent based upon
                     single engine speed.  If the application is
                     designed to take advantage of multitasking,
                     this number can exceed 100.

          An optional title can be placed on the output report by
          specifying an input parm on the EXECute statement.  This
          title can be up to 50 characters in length.  If more than
          50 characters are specified, the first 50 are used.  If the
          default titles are sufficient, do not specify a parm.


          The DATAOUT file is optional.  If a DD statement is present
          a record for each selected job or step will be written to
          this file.  The DCB parameter is shown for documentation
          purposes but may, and should be, omitted.  The syntax of the
          DATAOUT record is as follows:

         The SYSIN file and any control statements are optional.  If
         neither is present, then all steps for all jobs are included
         in the report.  Note that this can be a huge report since, by
         default, every step in every batch job, started task, and TSO
         user will be listed.  It is anticipated that this report will
         usually be limited by specific control statements which will
         specify which of the input records will be included on the
         report.  Following is a list of the input control statements.
         A detailed description of each entry will follow this list.

         Note especially the JOBLEVEL option which specifies that the
         report be generated at the job level rather than at the
         default step level.  Since this is a summary level, some
         of the detailed information is lost.

         Also note the INTERVAL option which specifies that the
         report be generated from the SMF interval records generated
         at the end of each SMF recording interval (usually 30 minutes)
         and at the end of each step.  This allows a means to track
         the resources used by long running jobs or system tasks such
         as CICS, ROSCOE, or ADABAS.  It may be important to track
         these jobs or tasks on a time of day basis.

         An asterisk in front of an option denotes that up to 1000
         of those statements may be entered as selection criteria.

             control break.

             Note that the JOBNAME keyword can also provide a
             starting offset and length specification within
             parentheses so that only a portion of the jobname
             will be used for sequence checking.  Thus a
             specification of JOBNAME(1,3) would only use the
             first 3 characters of jobname for the sequence
             processing.

             A maximum of four of the above fields may be entered
             on a given run.




             Some of the options have more than one spelling.  Also
             many of the options are allowed to be abbreviated to
             a shorted name as long as it remains unique.  That is,
             as long as another option could not also be abbreviated
             to the same name.


                        Special Date/Time Issues

         Selection of data by date and time is, by necessity, a little
         convoluted.  The SMF data for the information formatted by this
         utility has two different dates and times.  There is the start
         date and time for the job, step, or interval.  There is also
         the end date and time that is the time when the SMF record was
         created.  Being able to select by either is desirable.

         There are also three different date and time conditions that
         arise:

         1)  Need for all data for the same time range for several days.
             The example that comes to mind is wanting all activity from
             8:00am to 5:00pm for a date range.  Following is how to
             accomplish this:

             DATE=2003/07/07:2003/07/11
             STIME=08.00:17.00

             This would display only activity that started during prime
             shift on the specified dates.

         2)  Need for all data from a specific time on a given day until
             a specific time on another day.  This allows processing an
             interval that crosses the midnight time line.  Following is
             how to accomplish this:

             DATE=2003/07/09:2003/07/10
             STIME=11.00
             ETIME=13.00
             TIMEINCLUSIVE

             This would display all activity from 11:00am on the first
             day until 01:00pm on the second day.


         3)  Need for all data from a specific day and time until a
             another specific day and time.  This would also include
             activity that either started and/or ended outside of this
             range.  If would apportion activity that overlapped the
             start or end of the interval.

             IRANGE=2006/03/01,11.00:2006/03/01,12.00

             This would display all activity from 11:00am on March 3
             until 12:00am on the same day.


         See the additional documentation for DATE, STIME, ETIME,
         TIMEINCLUSIVE, and IRANGE for details.  With the flexability
         provided by this utility it really can get a little confusing.



                        Special Subtotal Issues

         The generation of subtotals almost certainly requires
         that the data be sorted in the same way that the
         SUBTOTAL statement is coded.  If not then a huge
         number of subtotals could be generated because every
         record would probably be a sequence change.

         For example:

             SUBTOTAL=JOBNAME(1,3),DATE,HOUR

                 would require a sort statement as follows:

             SORT=JOBNAME(1,3),DATE,TIME



                    D E T A I L E D    D E S C R I P T I O N


         1)  INTERVAL

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Produce the report at the using the SMF interval
             records rather than the step or job summary records.
             This provides a way to track the system resources by
             time of day for long running tasks or jobs.  Note that
             an interval record is created for all job steps, even
             short ones at end of job to record the resources used
             since the start of job or start of interval..

         2)  TIMEINCLUSIVE

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Requests that any time ranges that are specified by the
             STIME or ETIME keywords are inclusive.  That is, the
             earliest time of any range will be used as the start time
             of the report on the first day of the date range and that
             the latest time of any range will be used as the end time
             of the report on the last day of the report.  The
             exception to this is if the ETIME value only specifies a
             single time in which case it will be used as if it was the
             end time of the range.  Note that this keyword indicates
             that at least one DATE range and one STIME or ETIME range
             must be specified.

         3)  JOBLEVEL

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Produce the report at the job level using the job summary
             SMF records rather than the step summary records.  This
             results in a much shorter report but also results in loss
             of detailed information such as step name and program name.
             Some information will be cumulative such as elapsed time
             and CPU time while others will be maximum values depending
             on the field.

         4)  JOBNAME=jjjjjjjj(nn)
             WHERE jjjjjjjj is a 1 to 8 character jobname
                   nn is the starting position within the full jobname
                   to be used for selection

             ALIASES JOBNM

             Up to 1000 JOBNAME control statements may be entered.

             Select only jobs whose name matches the specified name.
             An optional index value can be specified to indicate that
             the specified name starts other than in position 1 of the
             job name.  A name of less than 8 characers is assumed to
             be generic.  That is, any job which starts with the
             specified characters will be selected.

         5)  EXJOBNAME=jjjjjjjj(nn)
             WHERE jjjjjjjj is a 1 to 8 character jobname
                   nn is the starting position within the full jobname
                   to be excluded from selection

             ALIASES XJOBNAME, EXJOBNM, XJOBNM

             Up to 1000 EXJOBNAME control statements may be entered.

             Exclude all jobs whose name matches the specified name.
             This will exclude even those jobs which may have been
             selected by a JOBNAME statement.  An optional index
             value can be specified to indicate that the specified
             name starts other than in position 1 of the job name.
             A name of less than 8 characers is assumed to be
             generic.  That is, any job which starts with the
             specified characters will be excluded.

         6)  JOBNO=iiiiiiii
             WHERE iiiiiiii is an 8 character JES2 jobid in the
                   following format to be used for selection:

                   JOB..... OR STC..... OR TSU.....

             ALIASES JOBNUMBER, JOBID

             Up to 1000 JOBNUMBER control statements may be entered.

             Select only jobs whose JES2 job number exactly matches
             the specified value.  The length must be exactly 8
             characters long and being with JOB, STC, or TSU.  This
             allows selection of a single job when the same jobname
             has been run multiple times.

         7)  EXJOBNO=iiiiiiii
             WHERE iiiiiiii is an 8 character JES2 jobid in the
                   following format to be excluded from selection:

                   JOB..... OR STC..... OR TSU.....

             ALIASES XJOBNO, EXJOBNUMBER, XJOBNUMBER, EXJOBID,
                     XJOBID

             Up to 1000 EXJOBNUMBER control statements may be entered.

             Exclude all jobs whose JES2 job number exactly matches
             the specified value.  The length must be exactly 8
             characters long and being with JOB, STC, or TSU.  This
             allows exclusion of a single job when the same jobname
             has been run multiple times.

         8)  DATE=sdate:edate
             WHERE sdate is the start date of a date range based on
                   the date when the step or job started.  It can
                   be any one of the following formats:

                   yy.ddd     - Julian
                   yyyy.ddd   - Julian
                   mm/dd/yy   - Gregorian
                   yyyy/mm/dd - Gregorian

             WHERE edate is the end date of a date range based on
                   the date when the step or job completed.  It can
                   be any one of the following formats:

                   yy.ddd     - Julian
                   yyyy.ddd   - Julian
                   mm/dd/yy   - Gregorian
                   yyyy/mm/dd - Gregorian

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Note: If the TIMEINCLUSIVE option is entered then the
                   lowest start date of any and all date specifications

             Only as many field names can be entered whose values
             will fit on a 133 character print line.

             More than one PRINT statement can be used if a large
             number of field names is being specified.

             IF A PRINT statement is not included, the following
             fields will be printed:

             JOBNAME,JOBID,GDATE,TIME,SYSID,PSTEP,JSTEP,PGM,USERID,
             CCODE,ELAP,CPUTIME,REGIONBELOW,REGIONABOVE,EXCPS,
             CPUPCT,JOBTYPE

        Many of the error messages refer to errors on optional control
        statements.  The control statement is always written to the
        SYSPRINT report file prior to performing syntax checking.  The
        last control statement printed will be the one containing the
        specified error.

         81) SUBTOTAL=field1,field2,field3,field4
             WHERE subtotals are requested for the report in the
             order in which the following fields are listed:

             A)  JOBNAME/JOBNM(offset,length)
             B)  DATE/SDATE/STARTDATE
             C)  EDATE/ENDDATE
             D)  SYSTEM/SYSID
             E)  PROGRAM/PGM

             H)  EDAYOFWEEK/ENDDAY
             I)  HOUR/SHOUR
             J)  EHOUR


             Note that the JOBNAME keyword can also have a starting
             offset and length specification within parentheses so
             that only a protion of the jobname will be used for
             sequence checking.  Thus a specification of JOBNAME(1,3)
             would only use the first 3 characters of the jobname for
             subtotal sequence processing.

             A maximum of four of the above fields may be made
             on a given run.
