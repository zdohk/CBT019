     This program will execute MVS or JES2 commands within a batch job or
     started task.  The command(s) can be requested from the PARM parameter
     on the EXECute card or from an optional parameter file defined by the
     DDname IEFRDER or both the PARM and the file.  If commands are entered
     on both the PARM and the optional IEFRDER file, the commands in the
     PARM are executed first.

     The command(s) can be entered by placing the command in the PARM
     parameter on the EXECute statement.  If more than one command is
     desired, separate the commands with a semi-colon.  Remember, MVS only
     allows up to 100 characters in the PARM.

     Commands can also be entered from the optional IEFRDER file.  The
     first 72 characters of each input record is used as the command.
     Command stacking with the semi-colon which is used in the PARM value
     is NOT allowed.  Each input record represents one command.


                              SPECIAL NOTES

     Most MVS and JES2 commands can be entered.  ALL commands will be
     echoed on the system console and syslog as an audit trail.  This
     PROGRAM IS PROTECTED from unauthorized use.


     In addition to MVS and JES2 commands, there are a number of
     special control "commands" that allow the user to tailor
     command processing.  They are as follows:


     DELAY

     Sometimes a time delay is desired between two commands.  This is
     accomplished by the DELAY control command as follows:

          DELAY=nnn        where nnn is the number of seconds to wait
            or
          DELAY nnn

     This will cause the program to wait the specified number of seconds
     before processing the next command.


     REPLY

     Sometimes a reply to an outstanding message is desired and the
     message number is not known.  This is accomplished by the REPLY
     control "command" as follows:

          REPLY jobname 'message text' 'reply text'

     This will cause the program to create a reply command with the
     'reply text' if there is an outstanding message for the specified
     job containing the specified 'message text'.  If the name of the
     job or task is not known or is the operating system itself, then
     code a jobname of '*' (asterisk).  If the compare for the 'message
     text' is not desired then code a message text of '*' (asterisk).
     This will cause the reply to be made for any outstanding reply for
     the specified job.  Note that an asterisk cannot be coded for both
     the jobname and message text.  This would be an illogical request
     indicating that the specified 'reply text' should be issued for the
     first outstanding message for any job.


     STARTED
        or
     STOPPED

     Sometimes a command or series of commands depends on the presence
     or absence of another job or started task.  A facility is provided
     by which this utility will wait for a job or task to either start
     or stop.  The format of the two control commands is as follows:

          STARTED jobname         which will wait for the specified job
                                  to start

          STOPPED jobname         which will wait for the specified job
                                  to terminate

     If the job is not STARTED or STOPPED per the command, the program
     will issue a non-rollable message to the operator's console stating
     that it is waiting and will wait for the appropriate event to occur.
     Once the appropriate job has STARTED or STOPPED, the message will be
     deleted and processing will continue.


     ONLINE
        or
     OFFLINE

     Sometimes a command or series of commands depends on whether or
     not a disk device is online or offline.  A facility is provided
     by which this utility will wait for a disk volume to either come
     online or go offline before continuing.  The format of the two
     control commands is as follows:

          ONLINE A=aaaa           which will test if the specified
               or                 disk address (if A= is specified) or
          ONLINE V=vvvvvv         the specified disk volume (if V= is
                                  specified) is online.  It will wait
                                  for the device to come online if it
                                  is not already there.

          OFFLINE A=aaaa          which will test if the specified
               or                 disk address (if A= is specified) or
          OFFLINE V=vvvvvv        the specified disk volume (if V= is
                                  specified) is offline.  It will wait
                                  for the device to go offline if it
                                  is online.


     If the device, unit address of volser, is not online or offline per
     the command, the program will issue a non-rollable message to the
     operator's console stating that it is waiting and will wait for the
     appropriate event to occur.  Once the appropriate device has the
     indicated status, the message will be deleted and processing will
     continue.


     UNALLOC

     Sometimes a command or series of commands, or batch step to
     follow depends on whether or not a disk device is online and not
     allocated. A facility is provided by which this utility will wait
     for a disk volume to come online and become unallocated before
     continuing.  An example of this requirement is the IBM FlashCopy
     facility that can be used to create an "instant" copy of a disk
     volume to another volume.  This facility requires that the target
     volume be online and not be callocated.  The format of the two
     control commands is as follows:

          UNALLOC A=aaaa          which will test if the specified
               or                 disk address (if A= is specified) or
          UNALLOC V=vvvvvv        the specified disk volume (if V= is
                                  specified) is online and not
                                  allocated.  It will wait for the
                                  device to have this status if it is
                                  offline or allocated.


     If the device, unit address of volser, is not online or is
     allocated to another job or user, the program will issue a
     non-rollable message to the operator's console stating that it is
     waiting and will wait for the appropriate status.  Once the
     appropriate device has the indicated status, the message will be
     deleted and processing will continue.


     IFSTARTED
         or
     IFSTOPPED

     Sometimes a command or series of commands needs to be issued only
     if another job or started task is running or not running but the
     list of commands should be bypassed if the condition is not true.
     This is similar to the STARTED and STOPPED commands but those
     commands wait for the job or task to stopped or started.  The
     IFSTARTED and IFSTOPPED facility is provided to allow a list of
     conditional commands to be executed or bypassed based upon the
     job's or task's indicated status without waiting.  The list of
     conditional commands is ended with an ENDIF command.  The format of
     the two control commands is as follows:

          IFSTARTED jobname       which will execute the following list
                                  of commands only if the indicated job
                                  or task is executing.  The list of
                                  commands will be bypassed if the job
                                  or task is not executing

          IFSTOPPED jobname       which will execute the following list
                                  of commands only if the indicated job
                                  or task is NOT executing.  The list of
                                  commands will be bypassed if the job
                                  or task is actually executing


     IFONLINE
        or
     IFOFFLINE

     Sometimes a command or series of commands needs to be issued based
     on the status of a disk device.  The list of commands should be
     executed if the current status is as specified or bypassed if the
     status is not as indicated.  This is similar to the ONLINE and
     OFFLINE commands but those commands wait for the device to achieve
     the indicated status.  The IFONLINE and IFOFFLINE facility is
     provided to allow a list of conditional commands to be executed or
     bypassed based upon the status of the indicated device without
     waiting.  The list of conditional commands is ended with an ENDIF
     command.  The format of the two control commands is as follows:

          IFONLINE A=aaaa         which will test if the specified
               or                 disk address (if A= is specified) or
          IFONLINE V=vvvvvv       the specified disk volume (if V= is
                                  specified) is online.  If the indicated
                                  status is true the list of commands
                                  that follows will be executed.  If
                                  the indicated status is not true then
                                  the list will be bypassed.  The list
                                  of commands is terminated with an
                                  ENDIF control command.

          IFOFFLINE A=aaaa        which will test if the specified
               or                 disk address (if A= is specified) or
          IFOFFLINE V=vvvvvv      the specified disk volume (if V= is
                                  specified) is offline.  If the indicated
                                  status is true the list of commands
                                  that follows will be executed.  If
                                  the indicated status is not true then
                                  the list will be bypassed.  The list
                                  of commands is terminated with an
                                  ENDIF control command.


     ENDIF

     The ENDIF control command is used to end a list of conditional
     commands set by an IFSTARTED, IFSTOPPED, IFONLINE, or IFOFFLINE
     command.  If there was no preceding IF.... command, this command
     will be ignored.

                                    SAMPLE JCL

          //jobname  JOB ...
          //STEP1    EXEC PGM=COMMAND,PARM='command1;command2;command3'
          //IEFRDER  DD  *
          command4
          command5

     Again, the commands can come from either or both of the PARM or the
     optional IEFRDER file.  If only one or two commands are required, the
     PARM can be used and the IEFRDER DD statement completely eliminated.




 Message Format: CMD001E THE DELAY CONTROL COMMAND SPECIFIED AN ILLEGAL

                         TO 999 - JOB ABORTED

         Action: ABEND U001

    Description: This message is generated by the COMMAND utility.  A
                 DELAY nnn "command" was encountered and the nnn value
                 which specifies the number of seconds to wait was
                 either not numeric or exceeded a maximum value of 999
                 seconds.

                         - JOBNAME REPLYID AND RESPONSE - JOB ABORTED

         Action: ABEND U002

    Description: This message is generated by the COMMAND utility.  A
                 REPLY "command" was encountered and there were not
                 three distinct operands.  The first must be a 1 to 8
                 character jobname (or * for any job).  The second must
                 be a message id or some characer string within the
                 outstanding reply message text (or * for any message
                 for the indicated job).  It can be enclosed within
                 single quotes if the string contains imbedded blanks.
                 The third operand is the text of the reply to be made
                 in response to the message.  Like the message id, the
                 text of the reply can be enclosed within single quotes
                 if the string contains imbedded blanks.


 Message Format: CMD003E THE REPLY CONTROL COMMAND HAS A JOBNAME LONGER

                 the job or task name, being longer than 8 characters.
                 It must be 1 to 8 characters long or an '*' to indicate
                 any job or task.


 Message Format: CMD004E THE REPLY CONTROL COMMAND REQUIRES EITHER A
                         SPECIFIC JOBNAME OR MESSAGE ID - JOB ABORTED

         Action: ABEND U004

    Description: This message is generated by the COMMAND utility.  A
                 REPLY "command" was encountered with the first operand,
                 the job or task name, being an asterisk and the second
                 operand, the message id, also being an asterisk.  This
                 is an illogical request since the reply text would be
                 for any message from any job or task.

                 established by a prior IF.... command.  The list
                 commands for an IF.... "command" must be ended with an
                 ENDIF "command" before another IF.... command can be
                 processed.  Nested IF statements are not supported at
                 this time.
